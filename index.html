        Because I desire to free folks from mundane chores,
        I automate.
        Thus far,
        I have automated information-management and signal-processing chores
        by designing and constructing software.
        Within those domains,
        much more can be automated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Much beyond those domains ought be automated, too.
        I envision automatons
        laundering, serving drinks, putting away dishes,
        and cleaning restrooms--doing chores which are currently impossible
        for robots
        but tedious (and, in some cases, outright unpleasant) for humans.
        Due to the vast amount of automation to be done,
        I expect that I can spend the rest of my life automating.
        Maybe, just maybe, the glorious day will come that nothing remains
        to be automated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Above all,
        I am a dedicated husband and father.
        My best and dearest friend is my wife.
        In loving companionship,
        she and I do all that we can to prepare our children,
        so they can become happy contributing members of society.
        My family brings me the greatest joy.

        I was born and raised in Utah, shared the gospel of
        <a href='https://www.comeuntochrist.org/beliefs/jesus-christ'>Jesus Christ</a> full time in
        Jamaica, and then completed a bachelor's degree in mathematics at <a href='http://www.byu.edu'>Brigham Young University</a>.
        While I was completing my studies,
        I met and married my gorgeous wife.
