        Currently I am pursuing a master's degree in computer science at
        <a href='http://www.byu.edu'>Brigham Young University</a> (BYU)
        under the advisement of
        <a href='https://cs.byu.edu/faculty/kseppi'>Dr. Kevin D. Seppi</a>.
        My research centers on empowering designers of
        physicomps&mdash;everyday devices enhanced with interactive computing
        power. By building a piece of software which <em>learns</em> how to
        perform the signal processing necessary for event recognition, I hope
        to let the physicomp designer better focus on designing. The following
        video paints the vision of the (near) future my work should help
        create:

        I was born and raised in Utah, shared the gospel of
        <a href='http://www.jesuschrist.lds.org'>Jesus Christ</a> full time in
        Jamaica, and then completed a bachelor's degree in mathematics at BYU.
        While I was completing my undergraduate studies, I met and married my
        wife. We are happily raising our beautiful children.
