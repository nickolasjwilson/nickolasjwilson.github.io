        I am a proud husband and father;
        I love my family.
        My best and dearest friend is my wife.
        Feeling my little boy wrap his tiny fingers
        around my pinky
        as we stroll through a park
        and hearing my daughter exuberantly sing
        bring me the greatest joy.
        Most of my time and energy I devote to providing material necessities for them.
      </p>
      <p>
        To provide for them,
        I pursue my twin passions:
        optimization and automation.
        When I make a decision,
        I like to thoroughly study the options and select the right one the first time.
        If an automaton can perform a tedious task,
        I would much rather write the algorithm for the automaton to execute than repeatedly perform the task myself.
        Hence painstakingly engineering data-management and -driven systems is my trade.

        I was born and raised in Utah, shared the gospel of
        <a href='http://www.jesuschrist.lds.org'>Jesus Christ</a> full time in
        Jamaica, and then completed a bachelor's degree in mathematics at <a href='http://www.byu.edu'>Brigham Young University</a>.
        While I was completing my undergraduate studies,
        I met and married my gorgeous wife.
